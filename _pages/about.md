Short Bio
======
Hello, I'm a current senior(Graduation in May 2026) at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a B.S. in Machine Learning and Statistics. I've gained expereince with various tools and technologies in the machine learning industry, both in my time at Carnegie Mellon and in proffesionial domains. From gathering and managing data using tools such as SQL and Pandas to developing and training models using tools such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, to finally deploying and monitoring models using technologies such as Docker, Jenkins, Mlflow and Git. Similarly, I have an extensive statistical and analysis background with various courses on parametric and non parametric regression, advanced probability theory, and other common data science practices. Above, you will find an online form of my resume, along with a list of applicable projects and repos.
