Short Bio
======
Hello, I’m a senior at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in May 2026 with a B.S. in Machine Learning and Statistics. I’ve developed hands-on experience with a wide range of tools and technologies in the machine learning space—both through academic coursework and professional roles.

My experience spans the full machine learning pipeline: from data gathering and management using tools like SQL and Pandas, to model development with TensorFlow and PyTorch, and finally to deployment and monitoring using technologies such as Docker, Jenkins, MLflow, and Git.

In parallel, I’ve built a strong foundation in statistical analysis, with coursework covering parametric and nonparametric regression, advanced probability theory, and core data science practices.

Above, you’ll find an online version of my resume along with my Github along the side that hosts relevant projects.
